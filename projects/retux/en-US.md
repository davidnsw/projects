## Features

- Minimalist. Leveraging advanced features of TypeScript Retux reduces boilerplate code with better type-inferring and auto-completion.
- Declarative. Action-First instead of Action-Creator-Fisrt desgin results in code that is clean and easy to read for new contributors and future-self.
- Type-safe(strongly-typed). Retux enforces strict typings. With the utilities in Retux you will never lose the strictness of typings while enjoying great flexibility.
- Scalable. A Retux module can be easily split into isomorphic sub-modules. Retux can also optionally leverage the power of meta-programming on modern engine for further performance boost.
