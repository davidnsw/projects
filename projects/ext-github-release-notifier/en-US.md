Chrome / Firefox extension for watching Github releases.

<hr class="read-more" />

Unofficial "polyfill" for watching Github releases. It was based on [this](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/410#issuecomment-291797759) lovely idea. A year later Github finally added basic official [support](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-11-27-watch-releases/).

It uses Github APIs and takes advantage of 304 cache.
