1. Accuracy. Unlike other regex based implementations, this plugin uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by PostCSS to accurately locate rules.
2. Safety. Adding `!important` to every declarations might break styles. This plugin will skip unnecessary declarations.
3. Configurability. Flexible and fine-grained control over the plugin.
