[Neutrino 9](https://neutrinojs.org) preset for WebExtension development with hot reload and framework devtools.

<hr class="read-more" />

Zero upfront configuration necessary to start developing and building a WebExtension.

Run development mode in a fake WebExtension environment which supports hot reload and framework devtools.

Webpack chunks are translated into manifest configs nicely.

Outputs are bundled for each browser respectively, with different manifest.

Works well with other official Neutrino presets.
