This is also an attempt to replace Class components with React Hooks, which brings great convenience and pleasant development experience.

Managing data and resources with GraphQL is also powerful and dead easy.

With Netlify CMS and [Utterances](https://utteranc.es), post files and comments are stored back to Github which reduces the dependency of third-party services.
