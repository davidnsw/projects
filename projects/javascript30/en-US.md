30-day vanilla JS coding challenge. Inspired by Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

<hr class="read-more" />

Some of my interesting ideas:

- [Day 4 Queue*2 = Stack](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/YeNKoN): Visualized stack based on two queues.
- [Day 7 Stack*2 = Queue](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/QQvKjo): Visualized queue based on two stacks.
- [Day 19 Webcam Fun](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/RQYVzm): With canvas transformation.
- [Day 20 Levitation Charm](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/MQqLVe): Native Speech Recognition.
- [Day 23 Country Flags Game](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/LQMMxq): With Speech Synthesis.
- [Day 27 Jelly Pickle](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/yvrdEr): handwritten spring algorithm.
- [Day 29 Digital Clock](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/PQrQQY): CSS transform clock. And a updated version - a [counter](https://codepen.io/straybugs/pen/PRGZBa) based on [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) and [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/).
